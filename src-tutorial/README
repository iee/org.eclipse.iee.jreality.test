See http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality/mediawiki/index.php/Developer_Tutorial
for an up-to-date documentation of these tutorial examples.  

The following directions stem from a much earlier release of jReality and 
are intended to be used only if you do not have access to an IDE such as 
eclipse (www.eclipse.org).

Old directions:
tutorial readme:

To get started, download the jar file from www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality.
Add it into your classpath. Then change to this folder and type
  
  javac de/jreality/tutorial/*/*.java
  
When compilation finished, you can run an example,
i. e. de.jreality.tutorial.geom.Cube04, by

  java de.jreality.tutorial.geom.Cube04
  
HINT: Try pressing 'E' (first click into the viewer component) to encompass.
  
Up to now, you will only have software rendering, to get much faster
OpenGL rendering, download jogl https://jogl.dev.java.net/ - choose 
the current release build. Download both the file jogl.jar (put this into
your classpath) and the jogl-natives-{platform}.jar. Then unzip all
.dll (win), .so (linux/solaris) or .dynlib (macos) files to this folder:

  unzip jogl-natives-linux-i586.jar *.so (for linux)

Now run the example again, but add the current folder as java.library.path:

  java -Djava.library.path=. de.jreality.tutorial.geom.Cube04
  
Now the application should startup with the jogl viewer - rendering
much faster than the software viewer.
